							<h1>To Apoorva</h1>
							<p>I'm a terrible human being, i am a monster to hurt someone like this, and i feel terrible about it.I didn't mean it but i should have seen it and realized that it was in poor taste, and i blame myself for it.I truly am sickened by what i did but i love you and i never want to hurt you like this, it hurts me too to see that i am causing such pain to the one i shouldn't hurt ever, to the one who i always tell that i'll be there for.If i ever do this again you should leave me and never look back because if i do this again i am unworthy of you.I don't want a physical relation i dont care if we never are physical as long as we are together as friends as partners as whatever else.I will never do something that hurts you, and i really am sorry for what i did. and i know i have said all of this but i wanted to write this again to apologize again. <br>
							I'll apologize for this wordlessly every day of my life because im just glad that you stuck with me
							<br><br>
							Yours Always <br>
							A dumb idiot <br>
