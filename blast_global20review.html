                <strong>With the first event of the year coming up in a week with a massive <b>$1 Million</b> prize pool, let’s take a look at how the teams are looking coming into 2021.</strong>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-3"></div>
                    <div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/blast_premier_seeding.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>

                <h2>Seeding</h2>
                <p>Blast Premier Global Finals is using the team seeding method of determining the matchups and pick/ban orders for the opening games. This means that all the teams have ranked each other and the rankings have been averaged to the following
                    seeding.
                </p>
                <strong>
					<ol>
						<li>Astralis</li>
						<li>Vitality</li>
						<li>Natus Vincere</li>
						<li>G2</li>
						<li>Furia</li>
						<li>Team Liquid</li>
						<li>Complexity</li>
						<li>Evil Geniuses</li>
					</ol>
				</strong>
                <p>The seeding seems to be well balanced with the EU teams in the first half and the NA teams in the second half. Complexity also find themselves at the bottom of the list due to a variety of issues that we’ll cover below.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Event Format</h2>
                <p>The event is going to be a double eliminations style 8 team bracket. If any team loses 2 matches they are eliminated from the tournament. Unlike other big events, however, this event will have a best of 3 grand final, thus will not have
                    any upper bracket advantage.
                </p>

                        <strong>1. ASTRALIS</strong><br><strong> Expected Lineup:</strong> Device, Dupreeh, Magisk, Gla1ve, Xyp9x, (Bubzjki on Nuke)
                        <p>Coming in at number one is the greatest lineup to ever play CSGO, Astralis. While they are not playing at their all-time peak at the moment, there is no doubt that they are the favorites in this tournament. Coming off of wins at
                            both Dreamhack Masters Europe, and IEM Global Challenge, they look in form and ready to win their third event in a row. Add to that the wildcard of Bubzjki replacing Xyp9x on Nuke which hasn’t paid off just yet but might end
                            up being a secret to success if they have practiced over the player break.

                        <strong>2. VITALITY</strong><br><strong> Expected Lineup:</strong> Zywoo, Shox, Misutaa, Apex, Rpk, Nivera
                        <p>At number two we have one of the most consistent teams of 2020. Vitality placed well in almost all events they attended and with the addition of Nivera as the sixth man, they have shown that they are capable of lifting the trophy.
                            While they did not do well at the IEM Global Challenge they are still one of the best teams in attendance and will give every team a run for their money.

                        <strong>3. Natus Vincere</strong><br><strong> Expected Lineup:</strong> S1mple, electron1c, Flamie, Boomb14, Perfect0, (Bit on inferno)
                        <p>While Navi has had their woes in the previous season, they are still a major contender for titles with the insane performances of s1mple and electronic. Perfect0 has stepped up massively in the past tournaments and Navi will need
                            him to do the same if they want to win the tournament. The addition of Bit on inferno as a replacement for Flamie seems to be going well so far and is only set to improve as they get more practice. If the stars align for Navi
                            they could definitely look to take this trophy home.

                        <p>The NiKo move impressed everyone initially but is yet to pay off in the massive way that everyone expects. NiKo himself seems to be firing on all cylinders but has it come at the cost of team performance as it did in Faze? Only
                            time will tell.

                        <strong>5. Furia</strong><br><strong> Expected Lineup:</strong> Yuurih, Kscerato, Vini, Art, Junior
                        <p>With Hen1 being benched from the lineup, Furia looks to Triumph’s Junior to fill the awper’s shoes. What would be more difficult to replicate is the clutching prowess of Hen1 that allowed Art to carry out his plays of aggression.
                            Given time this roster can surely reach and maybe even exceed the heights of the previous one, but a top result can’t be expected at this stage.

                        <strong>6. Team Liquid</strong><br><strong> Expected Lineup:</strong> Elige, NAF, Stewie2k, Grim, Fallen
                        <p>Fallen takes over the Liquid ship in place of Twistzz, the long time MIBR IGL will look to take the team to victory not just here at Blast but at the eventual Major. The departure of Twistzz might lead to a lack of firepower that
                            will have to be compensated by Fallen’s AWP prowess. After Liquid’s shocking run at IEM Global Challenge, they are certainly a dark horse for the championship but only time will tell if the Brazillian Bet will pay off.

                        <strong>7. Complexity</strong><br><strong> Expected Lineup:</strong> BlameF, JKS, Konfig, Rush, Jugi
                        <p>The roster woes for Complexity continue as Poizon has been put on medical leave due to emergency surgeries. The team was forced to use OttoND at the IEM Global Challenge but have decided to get JUGI as a stand-in for Blast. Though
                            JUGI’s form hasn’t shown in his outings with Astralis, the juggernaut fans will all hope for a decent showing here and a quick recovery for Poizon especially, given rumors of JKS leaving the team for his old Australian gang
                            in Extremum.

                        <p>Evil Geniuses remain an unknown quantity coming into this event. Their last official game was against Chaos in November which they lost 2-1. Having canceled their 2020 trip to Europe due to health concerns, they’ll likely have
                            to spend their time here getting up to speed with the high level of EU Counter-Strike. Just likely Complexity and Furia, EG are not a contender for the title but have the upset potential in a match or two.
