							<p>August brought us the end of the player break and with that came our first event in the form of the DreamHack Open Summer.The event was conducted <b>from August 8th to August 16th.</b><br>Even though this was the first event there weren't many upsets in the tournament which are usually expected to occur as teams start practicing at separate times and some teams are rusty due to lack of practice.The only slight upset was <b>Chaos being in the top 4 instead of a shaky Cloud9.</b></p><p><span class="image right"><img src="images/grim.jpg" alt="Grim" /></span><br><br>For <b>Liquid</b> this was the first event with their new player <b>Grim who is replacing nitr0</b> on the lineup as the latter moves to Valorant after shaky performances in previous tournaments.For a first showing Grim was playing incredibly with an <b>average tournament rating of 1.28.</b>He had great showings as Liquid stomped on Ze Pug Godz and defeated Chaos to reach the playoffs in 2 matches.In the semis Liquid defeated TeamOne with similar ease to make it<b> to the finals without dropping a map.</b></p><p><span class="image left"><img src="images/furia.jpg" alt="Furia" /></span><br>The other high ranked team in attendance was<b> Furia</b> who had a similarly easy run to the finals dropping only one map before the finals to their fellow brazilians in TeamOne. <b>In the finals Furia and Liquid clashed but Furia bested Liquid again</b> even with the added firepower provided by the addition of Grim.The series was a full 3 map affair with Liquid managing to secure the firstmap of Vertigo but lost on the following maps with the second map (Nuke) going to overtime.</p><br><blockquote>Overall the North American portion of the tournament was concluded without many unexpected results.The new Liquid lineup looks rejuvinated with good results ahead as they increase their fragging power and the less analytical and more emotional and controlled coaching style of their coach Moses.</blockquote>
